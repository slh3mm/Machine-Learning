# Machine-Learning

This course introduces fundamental concepts and methods to learn from data for computational data analysis, including pattern recognition, prediction, and visualization. The primary focus is on giving an introduction to machine learning techniques applied to various problems. The students in this course will be able to:

(1) Handle data from multiple fields and create end-to-end machine learning projects using open source libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.\
(2) Formulate various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques including linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, random forests, boosting, k-means, and hierarchical clustering.\
(3) Acquire practical knowledge of artificial neural networks, including deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks using TensorFlow 2.0 API.\
