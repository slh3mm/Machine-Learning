# Machine Learning (UVA CS 4774)

This course introduces fundamental concepts and methods to learn from data for computational data analysis, including pattern recognition, prediction, and visualization. The primary focus is on giving an introduction to machine learning techniques applied to various problems. The students in this course will be able to:

(1) Handle data from multiple fields and create end-to-end machine learning projects using open source libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.\
(2) Formulate various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques including linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, random forests, boosting, k-means, and hierarchical clustering.\
(3) Acquire practical knowledge of artificial neural networks, including deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks using TensorFlow 2.0 API.

This course included a semester-long project that involved working in a team of three students to use machine learning to make meaningful contribution to the well-being of the state of Virginia and its residents. The project will provides a unique opportunity for exploring one or more areas of machine learning covered in this course's content. The groups will be able to: find a dataset, apply machine learning techniques to it and create a video to present its solution in the most creative and innovative way.
